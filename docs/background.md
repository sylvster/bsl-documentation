# Background

What exactly are we working with in this machine learning project?

## Seismic Monitoring Station

Seismic monitoring stations are facilities designed to detect, measure, and record seismic waves generated by earthquakes, volcanic activity, and other sources of ground motion. These stations play a crucial role in earthquake monitoring, early warning systems, and understanding the Earth's internal structure.

The Berkeley Seismometer Lab supervises the seismic monitoring stations under the network code BK, which are stations located around Berkeley, but also found throughout various locations in California.

## Detecting Faulty Seismometer Data

Within each station, there are seismometers placed underground listening to ground motion. By nature, these seismometers have to be sensitive to capture tremors of various magnitudes. This also means that it's often prone to errors contributed by various factors.

This project aims to create a machine learning model trained on correct and faulty seismic readings, which will allow us to leverage the neural network to detect and alert the Berkeley Seismology Lab every time an abnormal activity is detected in these sensors. Eventually, we will be able to quickly investigate seismometers and identify the root causes based on the machine learning model's report.

## Types of Sensors

There are different types of seismometers that fulfill separate roles. The **broadband seismometer** is used to detect a wide range of frequencies, while the **strong-motion seismometers** are optimized to measure large, fast movements. There are also **geophone** readings used for monitoring in the field.

Because each sensor provides a different graph output that take on completely different trend shapes, we have three different machine learning models trained in each respective field.

## Identifying Specific Stations

As seen from earlier, there are many, many seismic monitoring stations located around the world. To uniquely identify them, we use a hierarchical that provide us details on the location of the monitoring station. Consider the following name:

`BK.BKS.00`

- BK - network code: The first part, "BK", represents the **network** to which a station belongs. Network codes are typically assigned to organizations or agencies that operate a collection of seismic stations.
- BKS - station code: The second part, "BKS", refers to the **specific seismic station** within the network. They are a unique identifier for a particular location within the network, usually based on the city, region, or a predefined code within the network.
- 00 - channel code: Lastly, "00" refers to a **channel** at the station. Seismic stations can have multiple sensors (channels) that record different types of data.

## Sub-components of Seismometers

Lastly, there are a few subcomponents of seismometer that would provide a helpful context for the next page. Seismometers record data in three-dimensional directions: two horizontal, and one vertical. Think of it simply as recording movements in terms of x, y, and z.

Each seismometer has unique labels for these directions. 

### Broadband
- HHE: Horizontal East-West direction (measures horizontal ground motion in the East-West direction).
- HHN: Horizontal North-South direction (measures horizontal ground motion in the North-South direction).
- HHZ: Vertical direction (measures vertical ground motion).

### Strong Motion
- HNE: Horizontal East-West direction (measures horizontal ground motion in the East-West direction).
- HNN: Horizontal North-South direction (measures horizontal ground motion in the North-South direction).
- HNZ: Vertical direction (measures vertical ground motion).

In the case of geophone, it contains labels of DP1, DP2, and DP3. What each label represents specifically is out of scope for this project.
